# Temperature control
This is the simulation of a temperature control made in arduino.

## Usage
To enter: 
- The temperature sensor must be in the range of 32°C and 38°C;
- The ultrasonic sensor needs to detect something nearby;
- The place cannot be crowded (the LCD display shows the capacity).

To exit: 
- The second ultrasonic sensor must detect something approaching and then moving away.
